#Daily Challenge
#Part 1 : Quizz :

#Answer the following questions

#What is a class? Classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something
#it is a blueprint or a template used to create objects

#What is an instance?an instance refers to a specific realization or occurrence of a class, created at runtime
#What is encapsulation?refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, usually a class.
#What is abstraction?It involves representing essential features of an entity while hiding the unnecessary details or complexities. 
#What is inheritance? it  allows a new class (derived or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (base or parent class). It enables code reuse, promotes the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, and facilitates the implementation of the "is-a" relationship between objects
#What is multiple inheritance? it allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.
#What is polymorphism? it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
#What is method resolution order or MRO? it refers to the order in which methods are resolved or searched for in a class hierarchy during method invocation in object-oriented programming,
